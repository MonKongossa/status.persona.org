Network issues at our SCL2 datacenter has blocked data replication between our PHX1 and SCL2 datacenters. 
This means that if during this outage someone changed their password or created an account hitting the PHX1 datacenter, 
they would not have been able to login at the SCL2 datacenter (if DNS sent them there) until after the outage. SCL2 incorrectly
had traffic being sent to it sporadically from 9:18 AM PDT to 10:37 AM PDT and then consistently from 10:37 AM PDT to 1:34 PM PDT. It's during these windows that the above potential problem would have been exhibited.
