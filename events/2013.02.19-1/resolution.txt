Network issue resolved itself causing the dbwriter tier to become available again. We drained traffic for browserid.org at SCL2 between 12:13 and 12:16 but failed to drain traffic for presona.org. This was subsequently drained at 12:29. We will monitor the situation and bring traffic back to the SLC2 site when it appears safe.
