All queued gmail.com emails were delivered over the course of the last two minutes.

We recently moved production email to a new, isolated account, and all new accounts have throttling in place by default: a maximum of 50 emails per domain per hour were sent, and the rest were queued until the following hour. A combination of real user emails and Selenium tests pushed us well over the limit for the gmail.com domain.

After our ticket was filed, an engineer at our email service removed the throttling from our new account, and the gmail queue was cleared rapidly.

While we're confident we have isolated the cause of the incident, this is still a preliminary timeline. The actual duration is still unknown. We will update this timeline as soon as possible.
